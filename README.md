  - The player, using augmented reality, must locate a portal in the real space from which various types of enemies will emerge and move through the environment.
  - The player can shoot with two weapons towards the center of the screen with a single touch. If the finger is held down on the screen, burst shots are fired.
  - The UI displays a mini-map or radar indicating the position of the monsters relative to the player.
  - Once the player eliminates these initial enemies, the final boss of the level will appear, which is harder to defeat due to its more complex movement and missile attacks.
  - The various enemies share the same AI script, but the configuration data in their Scriptable Object is different.
  - There is a boss enemy with its own AI script.
  - The game uses 4 scenes that are loaded additively and asynchronously.
  - Managers: Game Manager, Scene Controller, Audio Manager, Spawner Manager, Battle Manager, VFX Manager, Vibration Manager, Pool Manager.
  - AR Foundation - AR Core is used for the AR library.
